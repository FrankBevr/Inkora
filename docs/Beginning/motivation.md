# Motiviation of Inkora

Inkora is a little project, which allows me to teach myself to stick different kind of technologies together.


### Goal 

My personal Goal was to combine 
- `Javascript` with 
- `React `with 
- `ThreeJs` with 
- `MindAR` with 
- `ReactThreeFiber` with 
- `useInk`with 
- `ink!` 

Along the way etablish some kind of structure.

### Why? 
Because my personal goal is to create a Web3AR Shop which is full of web3ar products.    
A Web3AR Product, is a simple Product combined with a attached Hologram, which lives on Chain.  
> Example T-Shirt:   
> If a friend hovers over it, they see dragon flying out of your chest. This Dragon your Dragon. He lives on Chain.    
> Is it the new revolutionary idea ... nahh .., but real products, sells.  🛒

### Motiviation

Back to topic, I need an Idea. A Simple One.    
Mori had Birthday so I came up with a Beercoaster. Its simple.  
Quickly, I scratched out in my usual style.
