### Hola üå§Ô∏è

Yesterday was Saturday and I write a a quick Recap.

### Intro

On these kinds of Projects I chunk them usually. Take a piece of time that i like to commit and throw it against it. In this case 1 week.
Before I start try to particpates on Workshops with the hope I learn something which i was not aware of it.
Thats always the case, so declaring victory is already set in stone. üèÜ
