### Ola üå§Ô∏è

Not much today either. I had some guests so I made food.
I tried some things to get MindAR and React working, but didn't end up well.
In the evening a friend ask if I can take a look with him at his scratched out truffle project.
That was quite fun and got me bit of motivation for the next day.
