### Hoi 🐧

So yesterday was Wednesday.
Thats was a quite happy day. 🌤️
In the Morning, played around with Vitepress and their plugin system, I discussed some ThreeJS things in the Vue Community and then went back to the Application.
My Backendproblem was silly and laughable. I missed add cors to my express, but to get to this realisation i messed around with windows subsystem for linux for a while.
Backend solved and i was on fire.
Next up use SmartContract Interaction for the Midday.
Set up useink and fiddle it up to get it running with my local node.

> Oh men, they have 100chains as possible values but not the local substrate contracts node, thats hilarious.
Nonetheless as prouder i felt went it worked out well. After struggling with getting a value from somewhere, i started to break it down.
First get a Blocknumber, then get a Blocknumber frequently, then get a contract value and finally set up a contract interaction. 
This was my Masterplan and I met it till get contract value. 

Not so bad for a day, i would say. 
I slept fine and happy to got some hurdles out of my way.
Still way to much on the list for the last days, so I have to speed up and slim it down, as usual.
