### Ciao üçù  

Today I cleanup the Frontend.    
To switch Pages, i need some kind of StateManagement.    
Good oppurtunity to learn some stuff over Zustand.   
So I learned some Zustand, actually really similar to pinia from the vue side.  
It will not describe the whole day, because the day is still ongoing, but who cares.
