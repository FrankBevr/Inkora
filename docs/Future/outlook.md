# Outlook 

Deploy on Mainnet and maybe add two Friends more to the Coaster.    
One is the owner, one is the Barrunner and one is the Barkeeper.    
Because 2 other friends had birthday.   
Everyone gets a portion of the played games.   
Would love to include it and get used to azero thingie in ink.   

But first wait for some solid feedback.  

It was a lot of fun and got a good reason to improve further.  
One tiny thing after another 🧑‍🦯 ,like always 🦥
