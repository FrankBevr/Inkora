- little boilerplater
- doest rely on provider
- faster than context
- state mergy by default
- extendable
- little opinionated

Context -> Components
If state change, component gets rerendered, not good

In Zustand
ZustandStore -> compoentes
no rerendered

is it bad?

- rerenderes run react, so not necessarily
- rerenders don't change the dom, it has a shadow dom
- shadow dom is cheap

is it the solution?

- nahh

Now project
